## SIO Courses

### SIO(c) 209 - Deep Learning for Environmental/Geo Science

This course introduces students to the theory and practice of deep learning for environmental and geoscience applications. The course will cover the basics of deep learning, including neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and generative adversarial networks. The course will also cover the use of deep learning for image analysis, time series analysis, and (briefly) natural language processing. The course will include a mix of lectures, hands-on exercises, and a final project.

 - We broadly follow our new course book [here](/deep-learning-book), which is still being refined.
 - SIO 209 specific material can be found [here](https://github.com/climate-analytics-lab/sioc209-2024-sp)

## HDSI Courses

### DSC 80 - Practice and Application of Data Science

This course provides an in-depth exploration of data science principles and techniques, bridging lower- and upper-division coursework while covering algorithms, statistics, machine learning, visualization, and data systems, with prerequisites DSC 30 and DSC 40A, and priority given to DS25 majors.

 - The syllabus and all course details are available [here](https://dsc80.com/).
 - Github [repo](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2025-wi).

### DSC 200 - Data Science Programming

Computing structures and programming concepts such as object orientation, data structures such as queues, heaps, lists, search trees and hash tables. Laboratory skills include data analysis with pandas and xarray in Jupyter notebooks.
