Let's get hands-on with the data! You should have already received the example notebook with paths and data in.

### Topics

You will be touching on the following topics.

- Exploring the CMIP6 input and output data 
- Learning about xarray and plotting climate datasets


### Tasks

- Plot a map of the average global temperature between 2005-2015. 
- Plot a map of the difference in global temperature from 1850-1900 to 2005-2015 with appropriate colorbar and title.
- Plot similar maps for precipitation and daily maximium temperature.
- Plot a global average time-series of the variables above. Optionally include multiple ensemble members (or an indication of the spread across ensemble members).
- Each team member pick another variable and produce similar plots for those.

### Questions

No questions this week, but please prepare to present your plots and discuss your findings in class next week.
