Easily browse all the ship-tracks detected in [Watson-Parris et al. 2022](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2206885119) using our machine learning
algorithm. Each track as an associated MODIS timestamp so you can easily match with the underlying data. See the 
[ship-track detection](/projects/shiptracks) page for more details on their importance and effects.

*Note*, these tracks have been simplified and compressed for easy browsing. They are also not always very obvious in RGB imagery shown above, but the detection algorithm uses a microphysical composite as described in the paper. If you need the exact tracks used in our analysis please see the links below.
