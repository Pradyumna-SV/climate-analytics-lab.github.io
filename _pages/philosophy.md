In the Climate Analytics Lab, we value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure everyone has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience, both professionally and personally. Accordingly, all members of the Lab are expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times. We create our culture and our culture is inclusive.

To ensure that everyone in the lab knows the expectations and enjoys their time in the lab, we have created this set of expectations and principles that are available to every member. Please note that this is not a legal document, supplementing, but not supplanting, Department-, and/or university level policies for your level of employment or study.


## Inclusivity and diversity

Enjoyable, high-quality research can only be conducted when you feel
safe, secure, and supported. All group members are thus dedicated to a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity
and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, age, and/or religion. We do not tolerate harassment by
and/or of members of our group in any form, and we ask all members of
the community to conform to the following guidelines:

-   All communication, be it online or in person, should be appropriate
    for a professional audience, and be considerate of people from
    different cultural backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not
    appropriate at any time.
-   Be kind to others and do not insult or put down other group members.
-   Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist,
    or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
-   Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
    race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
    intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
    recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate
    physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
-   Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
    comply immediately.
-   Contribute to discussions in meetings with a constructive, positive
    approach
-   Be mindful of talking over others when discussing in groups, and be
    willing to hear out the ideas of others.

In addition to making group members feel safe and secure, diversity and
inclusion have numerous benefits to us all. Put simply, the greater the
mix of people in our group, the greater the mix of skills, experiences,
perspectives, and ideas we can collectively draw on. But the benefits of
diversity and equality cannot be fully achieved without actively
creating an inclusive environment.

Duncan will discuss the Code of Conduct with lab members who violate these
rules, no matter how much they contribute to the Climate Analytics Lab, or how
specialized or needed their skill set. If inappropriate behavior
persists after this initial discussion, formal processes, in line with
UCSD's work practice policies, will commence (Principles of
Community: [https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html);
Office of the Ombuds: [https://ombuds.ucsd.edu/about-us/index.html](https://ombuds.ucsd.edu/about-us/index.html)).

To report an issue, please contact Duncan; all communication will
be treated as confidential except in situations where University policy
requires mandatory reporting. In these cases, information will be shared
only with those university officials who have a need to know the
information to assist in the response to, investigation of and
resolution of a complaint. If you would prefer to talk through issues with someone outside
of the Climate Analytics Lab please talk with a member of the Postgraduate
Research Committee ([postdoc.ucsd.edu](postdoc.ucsd.edu)) or Human Resources ([hhr.ucsd.edu](hhr.ucsd.edu)).
If you or someone you know is experiencing sexual assault or harassment,
our Title IX coordinator is Lori Chamberlain, (858) 534-8298. More
information about reporting sexual assault or harassment can be found at
[https://ophd.ucsd.edu/](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/).

## Mental Health

There is increasing evidence that certain attributes of academic
research, including PhD-level studies, may challenge your mental health.
Specific factors driving this include:

-   Low pay and quality-of-life issues, particularly as a function of
    living in an expensive city as San Diego
-   Feelings of isolation in your research; e.g. everyone has their own
    topic and it can often feel as if you are working on your own
-   Uncertainty in your research, although it should be noted that, in
    research of all kinds, it is not just the outcomes that are
    uncertain, but the questions themselves!
-   Uncertainty in your post-PhD career
-   So-called "negative results"; i.e. at some point in your research it
    is likely that certain questions will be more challenging to answer
    than anticipated, or that you will feel you have spent
    days/months/years toiling with little to show
-   Feelings of imposter syndrome or uncertainty in your abilities
-   Burnout; i.e. feeling the need to work endless hours to make up for
    the above issues, and the subsequent exhaustion

All scientists come across most of these issues at some level. I
strongly encourage everyone in the group to take an active and
pre-emptive approach towards the maintenance of their mental health. I
assure you that you have the time and resources needed for a highly
successful PhD or postdoc. If there is anything that is causing undue
stress, or preventing you from performing at your potential, please do
not hesitate to let me or any of the postgraduate tutors in the
department know how we can help. You should also be familiar resources
on campus: [https://wellness.ucsd.edu/CAPS/resources/Pages/default.aspx](https://wellness.ucsd.edu/CAPS/resources/Pages/default.aspx). Every effort will be made to help you access the right support networks.

UCSD provides free counseling services for faculty and staff.
Information and confidential appointments can be made through the
Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP)
at [https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/support/counseling/index.html](https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/services/support/counseling/index.html).

## Outputs, publication expectations and standards, and open science

Where possible, all research outputs (e.g. papers) will be published
'Open Access' (OA) (preferably Gold or Diamond OA; for definitions,
please see the [Open Research Glossary](https://figshare.com/articles/Open_Research_Glossary/1482094)),
with manuscripts also uploaded to a relevant pre-print server (e.g.
arXiv) prior to journal submission, review, and (hopefully)
publication. Where Gold or Diamond OA is not possible, the manuscript
should be made publicly available via Green OA within three months of
acceptance. Please also note that, we are generally committed to
eliminating the use of journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact
Factors, in funding, appointment, and promotion considerations; and
assessing research on its own merits, rather than on the basis of the
journal in which the research is published. Duncan is personally committed
to these principles, thus you will be encouraged to think broadly about
your choice of publication venue. Duncan believes that the key guiding
principle for choosing a journal is that it is thematically appropriate
for the work you wish to publish.

Authorship on any manuscript or presentation will be openly discussed in
group meetings and should, if possible, include everyone who has made a
significant contribution to the work. A "significant contribution" can
include but is not limited to, interpretations of primary data and
development of ideas presented in the work; it need not include data
curation or financial contribution to the work undertaken. The order of
authors on a manuscript or presentation should be dictated by the
relative contribution made by each author
(see [here](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/01/30/all-journals-should-have-a-policy-defining-authorship-heres-what-to-include/) for
further information); in the case these contributions are equal, authors
should be listed alphabetically by surname. Where conflict arises, Duncan
will facilitate discussion to help resolve this. An open dialogue is
encouraged about this matter, ideally via authorship 'check-ins' that
will likely occur several times over the lifetime of the study, starting
early on. To help inform Editors, reviewers, and readers of our papers,
we will include an [author contribution statement](https://www.epj.org/images/stories/faq/examples-of-author-contributions.pdf) as part of a paper.

Reference managers are extremely helpful for preparing publications and
grant proposals. You are welcome to use whichever you like, however Duncan
has found Papers to be useful for both arranging and annotating papers.

Papers must be shown to and receive formal approval from all co-authors
prior to submission; this is consistent with guidance provided by the
Committee on Publication Ethics
([COPE](https://publicationethics.org/)), who state that all
authors must approve submission of work bearing their names. Please give
co-authors at least two weeks to comment on paper drafts; at busy times
of the year, they may need longer. We also strongly suggest that the
paper receives reviews from at least two colleagues prior to submission
to your supervisors; this will help improve the final product, as well
as providing a training opportunity. If you require any guidance regarding paper submission,
please speak to Duncan. Upon acceptance
(or rejection) of your paper, you must inform all coauthors of the
outcome as soon as possible and ensure all co-authors get a chance to
look at and comment on page proofs (N.B. many errors can be introduced
into manuscripts by the journal at this stage). Note that after paper
acceptance, final text and graphics files must be sent, in raw format
(e.g. .docx, .ai.) to all co-authors for their records/use within 14
days, with an accepted version (the so-called 'Author Accepted
Manuscript' or 'AAM') uploaded to the UC Publication Management System
and an appropriate online archive (e.g. arXiv).

All computers should be backed up, daily, to at least one location
external to your main computer (e.g. a USB hard drive or network drive).
Note, that while this may not be possible for large model datasets generated on 
high-performance compute (HPC) systems, full traceability of experiments
should allow for regenerating the simulation output if needed.

Upon completion of a project and where data confidentiality allows, all
data should be placed on an appropriate repository with a DOI; in the
case of publication, these data should be published alongside the
manuscript on a repository such
as [zenodo](https://zenodo.org). A curated version of all datasets used during
a project should be provided to made available on the Climate Analytics Lab
storage volume, in addition to being provided to Duncan on a hard drive or file 
share system; the quality of the curation
should be verified with Duncan. All group members must also adhere to
UCSDs [Research Data Management Policy](https://blink.ucsd.edu/research/policies-compliance-ethics/guidelines.html).

The group operates numerous computational resources, including the
shared storage volume and the Triton Shared Computing Cluster (TSCC).
These shared resources should be respected and not abused, and if you
need more computation resources then please discuss your individual
requirements with Duncan.

## Conference Logistics

You will be supported (financially and otherwise) to attend and
participate in conferences related to your PhD or postdoctoral research.
You can either pay conference and travel fees and be reimbursed, or
direct Duncan towards any bookings you need. In either case, you are
expected to register for the conference as a student (if relevant, or
cheapest category) and in advance to obtain discounted registration
fees. When possible, you will fly economy class and book the cheapest
accommodation possible. You are expected to share hotel rooms if
travelling with colleagues, even if they are from outside of the Climate Analytics Lab. 
You must book no later than 1 month in advance of the conference,
and preferably earlier to obtain the lowest cost travel costs and
accommodations. In general, each lab member will be supported to attend
1 conference per year if funding allows, with costs decided upon ahead
of time on a case by case basis and ideally reflecting existing funding.
You are strongly encouraged to apply for travel awards to cover
conference expenses.

Some conferences that we regularly attend are below (this is by no means
exhaustive, and other more specific, ad-hoc meetings will likely
arise):

-   American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting
-   European Geophysical Union (EGU) General Meeting 
-   American Meteorological Society Anuual Meeting
-   Climate Informatics
-   Gordon Conferences
-   International Conference on Clouds and Precipitation (ICCP)
-   AeroCom/AeroSat

Note that we will typically aim to attend conferences 'en masse', such
that accommodation costs can be shared and, based on experience, a more
significant group 'impact' can be achieved. Exceptions can of course be
made for conferences specific to your area of study and/or interest. For
any questions or concerns regarding your ability to abide by any part of
the travel policy or to request alternate arrangements, contact Duncan.

## Conference expectations and requirements

Conference abstracts must be shown to all co-authors at least one week
before the abstract deadline and inclusion of authors should follow
authorship guidelines for publications. Upon acceptance (or rejection)
of your abstract, you must inform all coauthors of the outcome as soon
as possible. You must also send a final draft of your presentation or
poster to all co-authors at least one week before the date of
presentation. Ideally, a near-final draft should be completed two weeks
before the date of presentation, so that it can be presented at a
Climate Analytics Lab weekly lab meeting; in this way, you will be able to receive
feedback from your colleagues. Presentation and publishing ethics, both
of which are at least partly captured by the Committee on Publication
Ethics ([COPE](https://publicationethics.org/)), state that
all authors must approve submission and presentation of work bearing
their names. The same applies to papers (see above). Note that after
material has been presented at a conference, this must be sent, in raw
format (e.g. .ppt, .ai) to all co-authors and data providers for their
records/use within 14 days; if appropriate, this material can be
uploaded to an appropriate online archive (e.g. FigShare, arXiv) where
it will be assigned a DOI, and will be useable and citable by the
scientific community.

## Working hours

We recognize that many of you have personal responsibilities and
obligations in addition to your work/PhD/postdoctoral studies. We
appreciate that, at times, it can be difficult to balance those demands,
and that a classic '9-to-5' day may not be optimal. Because of this, the
exact hours you choose to work are up to you. Being on campus between
1000 and 1600 most days may, however, help facilitate collaborative
working and, we hope, lead to a more fulfilling research experience.
Where possible, meetings and events will not be arranged outside these
hours to allow participation by all Climate Analytics Lab members, and a zoom
option will be provided when possible. Duncan prefers not to work on
weekends unless absolutely necessary -- but your work week may be
different, and when traveling for work these guidelines may be eroded.
Just be flexible with your time, be respectful of other people's
decisions on how they spend their time, and remember it is NOT how hard
you are seen to be working, it is the quality of your work and the
quality of your accomplishments and outcomes that matters. Working in person is not
the rule. Although we always appreciate interacting with people in
person, for some in the lab that may not be preferable, necessary, or
sometimes possible. Therefore, remote work options, if appropriate to
your research goals will be accommodated.

## Meetings

**Group meetings:** Group meetings are typically held on Monday at
1:00pm; all group members are expected to attend if they are not
otherwise engaged in other research-related activities (e.g., at
conference, attending training or a lecture, etc.) or on vacation. The
Climate Analytics Lab meeting is an excellent forum for updating colleagues on
project progress, developing research skills, and widening our
collective understanding. Meetings provide a forum for the presentation
of results, such as 'dry-runs' of conference talks, and more informal
discussions around research topics arising. At each lab meeting, we will
provide an opportunity to discuss good news and announcements from the
previous week and talk about any issues that have arisen in the lab. Every \~6 weeks
we will hold a group journal club discussion. If you have ideas for additional elements
to add to lab meeting, they are welcome -- please contact Duncan to discuss.

**Individual meetings:** Students have individual standing
meetings (30 min) every 1-2 weeks with Duncan. For all others,
meetings occur on an ad-hoc basis as personal situations require. If any
lab member(s) want to meet with Duncan, just drop him an email
and request a time. These will give you an opportunity to discuss your
progress and any administrative issues that you need addressed. You are
encouraged to send a short agenda ahead of time and to come fully
prepared for individual meetings; in this way, discussions can be
focused such that all concerns are addressed. Prepared updates can be
short (e.g. 5-10 PowerPoint), but should ideally contain an overview of:
(i) what your plans were for the last 1-2 weeks; (ii) work undertaken;
(iii) issues arising; and (iv) a forward plan for the next 1-2 weeks.
Such reports are an important way to self-monitor your progress, as well
as keeping your supervisor(s) informed of both positive and negative
developments. It is also important to take notes from our meetings, for your 
own reference only, so that key suggestions and actions can be captured. 

## Collaborative work

All lab members will be asked to help with projects outside of their
primary research from time to time. Advance notice will be given
as much as possible for these requests, so that you can discuss any
questions or concerns with Duncan.

The Climate Analytics Lab often collaborates with other research groups in
academia, industry, and government. As representatives of the lab, we
expect that members of the lab will act with professionalism and
respect, including preparing materials ahead of meetings and responding
in a timely manner to communications. It is encouraged to share
presentation materials with Duncan at least 24hrs before meetings with
collaborators.

## Communication

Where possible, avoid sending work-related email outside of 0800 and 1800. Most email 
servers provide [functionality](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/delay-or-schedule-sending-email-messages-026af69f-c287-490a-a72f-6c65793744ba) for
saving an email as a draft, such that it can be sent within the hours
stated above. Please give consideration to the timing of the email with
respect to what the recipient needs to do; for example, try not to send
an email at 1759 for something that is required for a 1000 meeting the
next day. **No lab members are required nor should feel obligated to reply
to email outside of their typical work hours.** However, prompt replies to
emails, within these times, is helpful. If you experience any challenges
related to flexible working within the Climate Analytics Lab, please do not
hesitate to contact Duncan. All communication will be treated as
confidential except in situations where University policy requires
mandatory reporting.

## Social media

In your work-related life, you may wish to engage with social media
(e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram). Please be considerate of others
when using these platforms, and respectful of how others may wish to use
them. For instance, Duncan uses Twitter and Facebook in a personal and
professional nature, and his account has a wide audience (including the
Head of Department, prospective students, funders, and other academics);
you must therefore bear in mind the very public nature of interactions
on social media, and that many people (who may not be on a specific
platform) will read and hear of online correspondence. We are not
compelled to engage with any social media, use any such media for
work-related purposes, and we will never pressure each other to 'friend'
or 'follow' each other.

## Journals

You should be familiar with recently published material relevant to your
PhD project. Below are some academic journals that may be of interest:

-   American Geophysical Union journals, including Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmosphere, Geophysical Research Letters and AGU Advances
-   American Meteorological Society journals including Journal of Climate and Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS)
-   Atmsopheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP)  
-   Nature journals, including Nature Climate Change, Nature Geosciences, Npj, etc
-   Science 
-   PNAS
-   Environmental Data Science
-   Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems

Signing-up to 'mail alerts' from specific journals and more general
publication 'feeds' (e.g. Google Scholar) are highly recommended; by
doing this, you can be kept informed of newly published literature
related to your studies. Our lab encourages publishing in society
and union journals as a first priority.

## Vacation

You are expected to take c. 3 weeks of vacation per year, beyond public
holidays and the college closure at Christmas. I strongly encourage you
to take this time so you can relax, visit family and friends, and
generally unwind from the rigors of work or PhD study. Please inform
Duncan of holidays or notable absences in advance via
email. Permission for holiday
is very rarely required, but please respect key deadlines within the
calendar year and the fact we work in a research group. It is important
to take vacations, respect weekends (or time in lieu) and establish a
sustainable work-life balance. It is also important to respect the time
and efforts of others, and the contribution of funders, and to note that
effective working will improve the quality of your research. Where there
are key time pressures, it is important to plan ahead to prioritize
meeting deadlines. If you struggle with establishing a sustainable work
life balance, please discuss this with Duncan at any stage.

Thanks, and please enjoy your time in the Climate Analytics Lab!
