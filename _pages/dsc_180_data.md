Let's get hands-on with the data!

### Topics

You will be touching on the following topics.

- Exploring the CMIP6 data and processing the NorESM2 output
- Processing the input4MIPS emissions data used to drive the models


### Tasks

- Process the NorESM2 data for each of the required experiments. The data can be found in `/glade/collections/cmip/CMIP6/{activity}/NCC/NorESM2-LM/{experiment}`
- Process the input data. The data can be found in `/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/inputdata/atm/cam/chem/emis/`
 - You will need to take the global averages of some quantities and regrid others

### Questions

Make sure your presentation is polished and answers the following questions

1. Could your group successfully replicate the findings of the paper, even if only partially? Provide context on the factors that contributed to your success or failure in replication. For instance, did you find any disagreement with the methodology used in the paper?
2. Please present the final visualizations created during the course of this project.
3. Summarize the key concepts and topics that you gained insights into through this project.
4. Engage in brainstorming to come up with potential ideas for further expanding this research, or propose innovative projects related to sepsis utilizing the MIMIC-III/IV dataset.
