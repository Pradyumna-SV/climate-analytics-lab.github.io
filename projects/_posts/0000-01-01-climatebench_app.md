Easily explore future warming under different emissions scenarios using an online ClimateBench emulator as developed in 
[Watson-Parris et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021MS002954). See the [emulation](emulation) project page for more 
details on the scientific and societal uses of such emulators.

*Note*, these emulator has been simplified and compressed for easy browsing. Only global total emissions of aerosol 
are considered and it has not been rigourously tested or benchmarked. **Please don't rely on it for any  realistic 
estimate of future warming!**   

## Data
 - The climatebench database used to train this emulator be found on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5196512)
