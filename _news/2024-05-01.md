"Multi-Fidelity Residual Neural Processes for Scalable Surrogate Modeling" has been accepted to ICML 2024! It introduces a novel multi-fidelity neural process and apply it to climate projections - generating a temperature projection of ERA5 out to 2100. The paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18846).
