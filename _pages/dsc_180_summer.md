I don't expect much over the summer but the following activities would be useful and allow you to hit the ground running in Fall:

- Skim the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report to get a summary of the latest climate change science, especially the figures: https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf
- Read the ClimateBench paper: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021MS002954
- Try out the xarray python library for working with climate data: https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/
